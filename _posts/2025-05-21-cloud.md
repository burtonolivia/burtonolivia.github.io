## What is NutriGenomeDB?

NutriGenomeDB is a web-based application that hosts manually crated gene sets defined from the signatures of gene expression after expression analysis of nutrigenomics experiments using human cells from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository[1](#local-urls). Through this web interface, gene expression data can be explored using interactive visualizations and extrenal gene signatures can be connected using gene sets and a gene pattern-matching algorithm. Through this, users can investigate how specific dietary components can modulate gene expression, a valuable resource for researches in nutritional and biomedical sciences.
