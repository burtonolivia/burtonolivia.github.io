## What is NutriGenomeDB?

NutriGenomeDB is a web-based application that hosts manually crated gene sets defined from the signatures of gene expression after expression analysis of nutrigenomics experiments using human cells from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository [(1)](#ref1). Through this web interface, gene expression data can be explored using interactive visualizations and extrenal gene signatures can be connected using gene sets and a gene pattern-matching algorithm. Through this, users can investigate how specific dietary components can modulate gene expression, a valuable resource for researches in nutritional and biomedical sciences.

## Key Features
**Gene-Centered Analysis**
Users are able to input one or multiple human gene symbols to explore their differential expression across nutrigenomics experiments. The results they provide include log2 fold change values, statistical significance, and links to the original data sources in the GEO database.

**Phenotype-Centered Analysis**
This module enables the comparison of external gene expression profiles with those in NutriGenomeDB using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) algorithm. This algorithm helps to identify connections between user-inputted gene expression data and existing nutrigenomic experiments, allowing for the generation of new hypotheses.

**Interactive Visualizations**
These visualizations show interactive line plots and sortable tables, making data interpretation easier for users.

**Data Contribution**
Researchers are encouraged to submit new gene expression data to be included in the database, promoting the engagement of the scientific community and expanding the discovery of new findings.


## Real-World Applications
**Identifying Nutrient-Gene Interactions**
The ability to understand nutrient-gene interactions will enable us to provide well-informed dietary recommendations and potentially in the future lead to more specific recommendations based on the gene interactions in individuals.

**Personalized Nutrition**
From understanding those nutrient-gene interactions, personalized nutrition could create more specified dietary advice either for individuals or those within a metabotype, resulting in enhanced health outcomes and greater consideration for individual differences instead of a more generalized perspective.

**Disease Prevention and Management**
Through exploring these different interactions, the prevention and management of disease will likely be increased, as there is already a plethora of evidence to indicate that there are key molecular mechanisms which influence the way certain dietary components can affect gene expression related to chronic diseases.
